                        <h3>About Us</h3>
                        <p>NGO Career is a UK based company offering a helping hand to individuals seeking jobs in the
                            NGO (Non-governmental organization) sector.</p>
                        <p>Our vision is to help Global NGO’s in the amazing work they do by matching them up with ideal
                            recruits to come and work for them. Simultaneously, we also aim to improve the experience of
                            those looking for a job in the NGO sector by providing a platform to enable them to find
                            their perfect match within the sector or NGO that they are interested in joining.</p>
                        <p>Global NGO has established a platform which will help job seekers interact with potential
                            employers. This new platform enables employers the ability to set up interviews with
                            candidates, giving applicants the opportunity to showcase their talents and interests to the
                            employers. Similarly, the platform is equally beneficial to employers looking for passionate
                            and energetic new employees who can add real value to their organization.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, the goal of our website is to improve the experience of NGO recruitment for all
                            those involved. By making the process of recruitment more enjoyable and efficient, we can in
                            turn only help to improve the great work NGO’s do for underprivileged people across the
                            world.</p>

                        <p>Our first objective is to help five hundred of our clients land their dream jobs in the first
                            six months of operation. For every six months that follow we will look to increase our
                            numbers even further, a goal that is entirely realistic given the resource we have available
                            to us and the solid network from which NGO has been built. </p>

                        <h3>Our Story</h3>
                        <p>It all started when a friend of ours expressed a desire to become part of an NGO. During his job
                        hunt, however, we realized that there was very little help to guide him towards achieving this
                        goal.</p>

                        <p>Given the importance of the work NGO’s carry out, and the eagerness of our friend to help out in
                        whichever way possible, we felt as though there had to be a better way to support him…</p>

                        <p>From this arose the question, how many more good and capable people are struggling with the same
                        obstacles and was there a way we could help them too?</p>

                        <p>We decided that a platform to help individuals, like our friend, find a job of their choosing in
                        this field of work would be an ideal solution. We decided to develop a simple process that
                        ensures high-quality candidates will no longer be lost due to a lack of accessibility or other
                        preventable obstacles during their job research and application.</p>

                        <p>Ultimately, the idea was to connect these job seekers with renowned NGOs doing a great job in
                        serving humanity.</p>
